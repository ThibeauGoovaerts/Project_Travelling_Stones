# A Global Stone Painting Adventure

## Overview

StoneTraveler is a solo project undertaken to create a web application that brings the joy of stone painting to a global scale. 
The concept is simple: individuals paint stones, register them on the app, and as others find these stones, they register their discovery and relocate the stones to new locations. 
Thus, the stones travel all over the world, connecting people through art and adventure.

## Key Features

- **Stone Registration:** Users can register painted stones by providing details about the artwork, location, and any special instructions for finders.

- **Stone Discovery:** Individuals can use the app to log the discovery of painted stones, capturing the journey of each stone.

- **Global Map:** An interactive map displays the current and past locations of registered stones, allowing users to see the global journey of each stone.

- **Docker Environments:** StoneTraveler includes two Docker environments, one for production and one for testing, ensuring consistent and reliable deployment.

- **Production Deployment:** The application is deployed on a virtual machine with OVH, ensuring accessibility and reliability for users worldwide.

- **Regular Database Backups:** Automatic backups of the MongoDB database are scheduled to prevent data loss and ensure the integrity of the stone travel records.

## Technologies Used

- **Django:** The web framework powering the backend logic and API endpoints.

- **MongoDB:** The NoSQL database used to store stone and user data.

- **Docker:** Containers for creating isolated and reproducible environments for production and testing.

- **OVH:** Hosting provider used for deploying the application in a production environment.
